    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>"For me, ginger should be everywhere," says Jean-Georges Vongerichten. "It's as good in marinades and vinaigrettes as it is in dessert." Here, candied ginger garnishes dark-chocolate pudding.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>5 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 quart half-and-half</li>
        <li>One 3.5-ounce bar bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Lightly sweetened whipped cream and sliced candied ginger, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, sift together the sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch and salt. In a large saucepan, add the half-and-half and whisk in the cocoa-powder mixture. Cook over moderate heat, whisking, until the pudding starts to bubble and thicken, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the bittersweet chocolate and vanilla. Pour the pudding into 6-ounce ramekins and let cool, then cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. Top each pudding with whipped cream and candied ginger and serve.</li>
    </ol>
